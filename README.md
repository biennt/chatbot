# AI Chatbot - simple demo
(learn how to use tools)
This is my own exercise when studying the course  [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models)

How to use (MS Windows):
1. Install python for windows
2. This will use [OpenAI API, so let register an account, topup and create API key from here](https://platform.openai.com/)
3. From the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/biennt/chatbot.git
python -m venv chatbot
chatbot\Scripts\activate
cd chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Put your OpenAI API Key in the .env file.

Start the chatbot
```
python chatbot.py
```
4. Using your browser to access http://127.0.0.1:7860/
Have fun!
